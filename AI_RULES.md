## Tech Stack Overview

*   **Frontend Framework**: React with TypeScript
*   **Build Tool**: Vite
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
*   **UI Component Library**: shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS)
*   **Routing**: React Router DOM for client-side navigation
*   **Backend & Authentication**: Supabase for database, authentication, and real-time features
*   **Data Fetching & Caching**: Tanstack Query for managing server state
*   **Form Management**: React Hook Form for robust form handling
*   **Schema Validation**: Zod for defining and validating data schemas
*   **Icons**: Lucide React for scalable vector icons
*   **Theming**: Next Themes for dark/light mode functionality
*   **Notifications**: Sonner for elegant toast notifications
*   **Date Utilities**: Date-fns for date manipulation and formatting

## Library Usage Rules

To maintain a consistent and efficient codebase, please follow these guidelines when implementing features:

*   **UI Components**:
    *   **Always** prioritize `shadcn/ui` components for all UI elements.
    *   If a specific `shadcn/ui` component is not available or requires significant deviation from its intended design, create a new, small, and focused component in `src/components/` using Tailwind CSS directly. **Do not modify `shadcn/ui` component files.**
*   **Styling**:
    *   **Exclusively** use Tailwind CSS classes for all styling. Avoid inline styles or custom CSS files unless absolutely necessary for global styles (e.g., `src/index.css`).
    *   Ensure designs are responsive by utilizing Tailwind's responsive utility classes.
*   **Routing**:
    *   Use `react-router-dom` for all application routing.
    *   All primary routes should be defined and managed within `src/App.tsx`.
    *   New pages should be placed in `src/pages/`.
*   **Backend & Authentication**:
    *   All interactions with the database, authentication, and real-time subscriptions must use the `supabase` client from `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`.
    *   Sensitive operations (e.g., user role creation) should leverage Supabase RPC functions for security.
*   **Data Fetching**:
    *   For fetching, caching, and synchronizing server state, use `Tanstack Query`.
*   **Forms**:
    *   Implement forms using `react-hook-form` for controlled inputs and validation.
    *   Pair `react-hook-form` with `zod` for defining form schemas and performing validation.
*   **Icons**:
    *   Use icons from the `lucide-react` library.
*   **Theming**:
    *   Manage dark and light themes using `next-themes`. The `ThemeProvider` is already set up in `src/App.tsx`.
*   **Notifications**:
    *   For user feedback and notifications, use the `sonner` toast library. The `Sonner` component is already integrated into `src/App.tsx`.
*   **Date Handling**:
    *   For any date formatting, parsing, or manipulation, use `date-fns`.
*   **File Structure**:
    *   New components should be created in `src/components/`.
    *   New pages should be created in `src/pages/`.
    *   Utility functions should be placed in `src/lib/` or a more specific `src/utils/` folder if applicable.
    *   Custom hooks should be placed in `src/hooks/`.
    *   Directory names must be all lower-case. File names may use mixed-case.
*   **Code Quality**:
    *   Write clean, readable, and maintainable TypeScript code.
    *   Prioritize creating small, focused files and components (ideally under 100 lines of code for components).
    *   Avoid over-engineering; implement the minimum necessary to fulfill the request.
    *   Do not use `try/catch` for API calls unless specifically requested, allowing errors to bubble up for centralized handling.
